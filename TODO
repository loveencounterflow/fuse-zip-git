* replace vector<T> with (s)list<T> in BigBuffer
* rewrite files tree: keep only short path information to simplify rename(), use hash_map (unordered_map) instead of map
* incapsulate call for zip_* into FileNode
* speed up position determination using bitwise operations
* iterate over chunks by iterator instead of indexing
* write memory cache to /tmp on fsync(). May be write compressed stream
